# Methodology:

We will use the Design Thinking framework, particularly focusing on the Empathize and Define
stages for Milestone 1. This will involve empathy interviews with each user persona (principal,
teacher, clerk, and student) to understand their challenges and needs. By creating detailed user
personas and mapping their journey through the LMS, we will identify critical pain points and
develop a solution that addresses these issues.
